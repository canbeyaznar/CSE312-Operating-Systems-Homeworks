NOTE: In the Palindrome program, the user should not enter extended ascii as input. And it shouldn't send an empty string. Faulty control is not done.

NOTE2: In some cases, the results of the Collatz program may be incorrect. In addition, the number of words Palindrome counts may be more or less than expected.
